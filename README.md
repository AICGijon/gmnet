# DLquantification
Repository for researching deep learning approaches for quantification.

## GMNet
GMNet implementation is based on pytorch. It is a neural network that focus on the quantification problem. It uses gaussian mixture models to represent the samples.

## Experiments
All the experimentation done with GMNet (HistNet or other DL approaches for quantification) lives in the folder ˋexperimentsˋ. You can check the corresponding documentation [here](dlquantification/README.md)

For the experiments using validation data with the labels provided by organizers (section **"Impact of data availability on quantification methods"**) you need to checkout the branch valcomp.
